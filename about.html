                Jazba: Helping Hands is a youth-based and youth focusing ‘not
                for profit organization’, founded by Ms Surbhi Jain in September
                2019 with Mr Vishrut Ashthana being the co-founder. They got
                their initiative registered under societies Registration act in
                December 2019. Changing the world by merely starting an NGO can
                sound unrealistic but Ms Surbhi follows the notion of ‘Nothing
                changes if nothing changes’, and motives the youth to work for
                the underprivileged section of our society with whatever they
                can.
