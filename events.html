                      Children were put into groups according to their prior
                      knowledge. A group of three to four kids was appointed to
                      each volunteer to ensure focus and prospering results.
                      Some kids who left their schooling for some reasons were
                      also encouraged to join us and resume their education.
                      Some were hesitant to study all together but we talked
                      them around. A bit of homework was given to them to make
                      sure that they stay in touch with their studies. Seeing
                      the kids working hard for their future made our efforts
                      worthwhile and filled us with a sense of accomplishment.

                      It’s the festive season and every child deserves something
                      special in it! October is a month of happiness and joy,
                      filled with lots of festivals and holidays, it is one of
                      the most awaited months of the year. It is more or less
                      ironical that things that may seem ‘special’ to the
                      children living in the slum area are just ordinary stuff
                      for most of the children. To kids who think getting food
                      thrice a day means having a ‘lucky day’, cloth items are
                      like magic. Team Jazba decided to conduct a distribution
                      drive in one of our adopted slum areas, Srinivaspuri, to
                      distribute clothes to the chilren.

                      “All work, no play makes jack a dull boy”. We conducted
                      some enthralling games for the little ones as exercise and
                      some fun is equally as important as studying. The kids
                      were excited to play and compete. A relaxed mind is a
                      rejuvenated one and a balance scheme of work and
                      relaxation is the proper way to keep the mind in trim
                      shape.

                      student gave a speech on Republic Day. Our celebration

                      decided to conduct some intriguingly engaging activities
                      for the little ones a few days before Diwali. Activities
                      included the making of greeting cards, colouring rangolis
                      and making lamps. The kids were very excited to use all
                      the decorative materials and were taught how to use them.
                      Colourful glitters, sheets and sketch pens were
                      distributed amongst them. Witnessing the joyous mood of
